Drill set 1

Calculate the probability of flipping a balanced coin four times and getting each pattern: HTTH, HHHH and TTHH.
>>> each flip has 50% chances since they are always independent events. with 4 flips, that's 50% 4 times. .50^4 == 6.25% for all.




If a list of people has 24 women and 21 men, then the probability of choosing a man from the list is 21/45. What is the probability of not choosing a man?
>>> 24/45, 53.3%



The probability that Bernice will travel by plane sometime in the next year is 10%. The probability of a plane crash at any time is .005%. What is the probability that Bernice will be in a plane crash sometime in the next year?
>>> 10% times .005% == .0005%




Each time a user clicks on a link on the website, there is a 5% chance that the user will be asked to complete a short survey about their behavior on the website. The data scientist uses the survey data to conclude that, on average, users spend 15 minutes surfing the company website before moving on to other things. What is wrong with this conclusion?
>>> The people completing the survey are spending longer on the site than those who aren't.






Drill set 2
Estimate each of the four probabilities using intuition. 
Calculate the probabilities using Bayes' rule. 

A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are sufferers. Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the test will:

-Be positive
estimate: 9%
Bayes': 10.44% = .98 * .005 + .1 * .995 = .1044

-Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
estimate: 98%
Bayes': 

-Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
estimate: 90%
Bayes': 

-Misclassify the person
estimate: 8%
Bayes': 10.05% = .2 * .005 + .1 * .995 = .001 + .8955 = .1005
